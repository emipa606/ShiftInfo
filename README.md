Keep track of what your pawns are doing

The mod adds a separate low-prio alert for each of the possible time assignment types, even those added by mods.
By default only those that has a pawn active will be shown, but there is a mod-option to have them always shown.

I made this mod after years of playing Prison Architect where you have a mini-display of what activity is scheduled at the moment.
Perhaps it can help to keep track of scheduling-issues when the amount of pawns in your colony grows.
